Intended Parents for all purposes, without interference by the Surrogate Couple. 
 G.         The Parties to this Agreement represent and warrant that all representations, 
whether oral or written, made to any professional, person, entity or Party, with respect to their 
medical history and condition, the surrogacy arrangement, the absence of any criminal 
convictions, criminal charges or warrants pending, and any and all matters contained in this 
Agreement are true and correct to the best of their knowledge, and that they have not knowingly 
falsified or omitted any material information concerning these matters.   
H.  Each Party individually represents and warrants that he/she has never been 
convicted of any crime (misdemeanor or felony, including but not limited to domestic violence, 
any sex crime, or crime involving minors) in any jurisdiction (worldwide, including but not 
limited to the United States, the European Union, and Asia), and there are no such charges 
pending and no current outstanding warrants exist for each Party in any jurisdiction. 
The Parties hereto understand that under California Family Law Code §3030,  
that unless a Court finds that there is no significant risk to the child, the Court will not award 
physical or legal custody of a child born from a surrogacy arrangement to an intended parent that 
has been convicted of a crime with a sexual component such that the intended parent is a 
registered sex offender or would be required to register as a sex offender under any state or 
federal law in the United States or the intended parent’s country. The Intended Parents 
understand that any court in the United States could require a complete background check on 
them in conjunction with any parental rights establishment action associated with this 
Agreement.

this Agreement is a fully informed decision, made after careful and unemotional reflection, that 
they have come forward voluntarily to enter into this Agreement free of any economic or 
emotional duress, that the consent or permission of no other person is necessary for the 
performance of this Agreement, and that no Party has any reason to believe that any other Party 
did not freely and voluntarily execute this Agreement. 
 J.       The Parties warrant that they understand that the medical procedures contemplated 
by this Agreement represent new, unsettled, and uncharted areas of the law.  Therefore, no 
warranties have been and/or can be made to the Parties as to the ultimate cost, liability, or 
obligation of the Parties that may result from the judicial processes with respect to the matters set 
forth in this Agreement. 
 K.  The Parties were introduced through Patriot Conceptions, LLC, located in 
California, which is a surrogacy parenting agency (“Surrogacy Agency” and/or “Agreement 
Facilitator”).  The Surrogacy Agency is not a party to this Agreement and therefore, makes 
no warranties regarding this Agreement and only facilitates this surrogacy arrangement 
and Agreement.  The Parties acknowledge that the Surrogacy Agency is designated to receive 
notice under this Agreement on behalf of the Intended Parents and the Surrogate Couple.

correct to the best of their knowledge, and that they have not knowingly falsified or omitted any 
material information concerning these matters.  Intended Parents further agree that any knowing

family histories, the surrogacy arrangement, and/or any and all matters contained in this 
Agreement are true and correct to the best of their knowledge, and that they have not knowingly 
falsified or omitted any material information concerning these matters.  The Surrogate Couple, 
and each of them, further agree that any knowing falsification or omission will constitute a 
material breach of this Agreement, to which all legal remedies, whether in contract or personal 
injury, shall apply.   
c. The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, acknowledge that they have received 
information about the Intended Parents and have had the opportunity to ask questions about 
them, all to the Surrogate Couple’s complete satisfaction.  The Surrogate Couple, and each of 
them, further represent that they are of sound mind and capable of entering into this Agreement. 
d. Surrogate warrants and represents that she holds a valid Arizona Driver’s License 
and is a United States citizen. The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, represent and warrant 
that neither of them are on probation or have been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime

 a.         The Intended Parents are entering into this Agreement with the Surrogate Couple 
whereby Surrogate will undergo an embryo transfer procedure of fresh and/or frozen embryos 
created by the eggs of Intended Mother, and sperm of Intended Father, so that a Child may be 
taken into the home of the Intended Parents as their own lawful Child.  These IVF/embryo 
transfer procedures shall be undertaken and/or supervised by the IVF Physician.    
 b.         Except as otherwise specifically stated herein in this Agreement, the Intended 
Parents shall take immediate, full and absolute custody of the Child upon birth, notwithstanding 
any congenital, physical or mental abnormality of the Child, and all decisions concerning the 
Child’s health, in utero and after delivery, shall be made by Intended Parents.   Any decisions 
concerning the Child’s health in utero will be made by the Intended Parents in conjunction with 
the approval of the Obstetrician, High-Risk Obstetrician, and/or IVF Physician.  In the absence 
of a material breach on the part of the Surrogate Couple, the Surrogate Couple shall not be held 
liable for support, custody, or any other liability relating to the Child born pursuant to this 
Agreement. 
 c.         The Surrogate Couple, and each of them agree and understand that any 
Child born pursuant to the conduct contemplated by this Agreement shall be morally,

purposes.  The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, agree that neither she nor the 
Surrogate’s Partner will form, or attempt to form, a parent-child relationship with any 
Child the Surrogate may bear pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and the 
Surrogate Couple shall freely and readily, immediately at the request of the Intended 
Parents or their attorney, terminate all parental rights to said Child pursuant to this 
Agreement in order to aid the Intended Parents in legalizing their relationship with the 
Child, and in order to aid the Intended Parents in the formation and/or continuance of 
their parent-child relationship with the Child. The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, 
shall immediately give full custody of the Child to the Intended Parents upon the birth of 
the Child.   
A Judgment of Parental Rights shall be filed by the Intended Parents’ attorney in 
California Superior Court, prior to the birth of any Child.  Said Judgment shall confirm 
the Intended Parents as the sole legal parents, grant them all rights and responsibilities to 
the Child, allow the Intended Parents’ names on the Child’s birth certificate(s), and order 
the removal of the Surrogate’s and/or the Surrogate’s Partner’s name from the medical 
records and birth certificate for the Child.  The Surrogate Couple, and each of them agree 
to sign off, in a timely manner on all necessary affidavits, consents, waivers, and said 
Judgment in order to terminate any rights and duties, if any, she or the Surrogate’s 
Partner has towards the Child and to attend all necessary court hearings, to establish the 
Intended Parents’ sole parentage, prior to and/or after the Child’s birth. 
 d.            Any Child conceived and born as a result of the conduct contemplated by this 
Agreement shall have all testamentary and inheritance rights from the Intended Parents, as the

from the Surrogate Couple, or either of them.  The Intended Parents shall have testamentary and 
inheritance rights from the Child as the Parents.  The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, shall 
not have any testamentary or inheritance rights from the Child.

 e.        The Parties independently take full legal responsibility for the completion and 
adequacy (except in the event of professional malpractice by any healthcare provider) of any and 
all physical and/or psychological exams, screenings, and/or testing.  
 f. The Surrogate Couple’s relinquishment and waiver of rights contained herein is 
final and irrevocable.  The Surrogate Couple, and each of them specifically understand and 
acknowledge that said relinquishment and waiver prohibit any legal action on their part to bring 
any action or suit to establish parenthood, custody, guardianship or visitation in any event, 
including but not limited to the event of the conviction, disability or death of the Intended 
Parents. 
 
g. The Parties stipulate and agree that the conclusive presumption of paternity set 
forth in California Family Code Section 7540 shall not be applied herein should the issue of 
Child’s paternity be raised by the Parties, or any of them, since, among other things, the Child 
will not be the “child of a wife.” Rather, in such a circumstance, the Child’s paternity, if at issue, 
shall be determined by blood/genetic testing done in accordance with the standards set forth in 
Family Code Section 7541, and Sections 7550 through 7558, inclusive. In addition, the Parties 
stipulate and agree that the rebuttable presumptions of paternity set forth in California Family 
Code Sections 7611 and 7613 shall also not be applied should the issue of the Child’s paternity 
be raised by the Parties, or any of them. 
 
h.  The Parties stipulate and agree that a mother and child relationship between the 
Surrogate and the Child shall not be established by the fact of her having given birth to the Child 
as set forth in California Family Code Section 7610(a).  Rather, if the maternity of the Child is at 
issue between the Parties, the Parties intend that maternity or non-maternity of the Surrogate 
shall be established by blood/genetic testing done in accordance with the standards set forth in 
Family Code Section 7541, and Sections 7550 through 7558, inclusive.  
 
i.  The Parties stipulate and agree that the parent and child relationship between the 
Intended Parents, and each of them, and the Child shall be formalized by a family court 
proceeding filed and completed before or after the Birth of the Child as set forth in Family Code 
Sections 7620(a), 7630(f), 7633, 7960, and 7962. 
 
5. MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS AND SCREENINGS

 b.        The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, understand that they have a right to 
request a psychological evaluation of the Intended Parents by a mental healthcare professional 
and, by their signatures on this Agreement, they hereby waives such right.  To the extent that any

and shall undergo psychological counseling, evaluation and/or testing if requested by the 
Attending Physician. 
     c.        The Surrogate Couple and Intended Parents have undergone, or agree to 
undergo, physical examinations under the direction of, and/or to the extent determined by, the

herein, and shall be paid for by Intended Parents.  Said physical examinations shall include 
testing for sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive tract infections (including HIV and 
AIDS) in order to protect the health of the Surrogate and Child.  The Surrogate Couple, and each 
of them, agree to undergo any further medical testing that the IVF Physician, the High-Risk 
Obstetrician and/or the Obstetrician deems necessary, while this Agreement is in effect and 
continuing up to two (2) months post-partum, abortion or miscarriage, paid for by the Intended 
Parents.  
 d.         The IVF Physician, in his or her sole discretion, may refer the Parties to another 
healthcare practitioner, hospital, or laboratory for a specific procedure or test.  The Parties’ 
signatures on this Agreement constitute each Party’s authorization to permit each Party to have

other Party to this Agreement.   
6.       GENERAL TRANSFER PROCEDURE

medical advice regarding the medical risks involved with an IVF embryo transfer, pregnancy 
and related procedures, (both present and future) and that she has also been advised of the

8.        SURROGATE’S CONDUCT 
 a.      Abstinence from Sexual Activity.   The Surrogate agrees to comply completely 
with all medical instructions given to her by the IVF Physician and/or the Obstetrician and/or 
any treating High-Risk Obstetrician, including any abstinence from sexual intercourse for certain 
periods and further testing which either the IVF Physician, the Obstetrician and/or High-Risk 
Obstetrician may deem necessary.  The Surrogate further agrees that she will not engage, and has 
not engaged, in any activity in which there is a possibility of semen being introduced into her 
body such that the possibility of a pregnancy other than that contemplated by this Agreement 
may occur.  All Parties agree that from the time of the first medical examination pursuant to 
Section 5, above, through to the time of delivery of the Child, or such further time as directed by 
the IVF Physician, Obstetrician and/or High-Risk Obstetrician, she will have abstained and will 
continue to abstain from sexual activity, including intercourse, with any person (including the 
Surrogate’s Partner) who has not been tested by or at the direction of the IVF Physician, that 
would allow the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV and AIDS).   
 The Surrogate’s Partner shall not have sexual relations, including intercourse, with 
anyone other than the Surrogate. In addition, the Surrogate’s Partner agrees to comply with all 
instructions provided by the IVF Physician, the Obstetrician and/or High-Risk Obstetrician with 
respect to sexual activity.  The Surrogate’s Partner acknowledges and understands that this may 
include abstinence from sexual intercourse for certain periods of time.  
In the event Surrogate becomes pregnant by any means other than that contemplated by 
this Agreement through any fault or negligence of her own, said pregnancy shall constitute an 
incurable material breach of this Agreement, to which all legal remedies apply, and in which 
case the Intended Parents shall have no responsibility to the child and/or any of the Surrogate’s 
medical expenses.   
 The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, agree to assume parental rights and 
responsibilities for the child(ren) born to Surrogate if it is determined that the Surrogate is the 
genetic parent of the child(ren).  Unless it is determined that the Surrogate or the Surrogate’s 
Partner is the genetic parent of the child(ren), the Intended Parents agree to accept custody of and 
to assume full parental rights and responsibilities for the Child as the sole legal parents, 
immediately upon the Child’s birth, regardless of any impairment of the Child (and subject to the 
breach provisions of this Agreement). 
 b. Medical Instructions.  The Surrogate agrees to adhere to all medical instructions 
given to her by the IVF Physician, as well as the Obstetrician, High-Risk Obstetrician, or 
Attending Physician.  Surrogate understands that her failure to follow all medical instructions 
shall be a material breach of this Agreement.   
The Surrogate also agrees to follow a prenatal medical examination schedule as 
prescribed by the IVF Physician, Obstetrician, and/or High-Risk Obstetrician, and/or any 
additional medical examinations requested by the Intended Parents, as well as to adhere to all 
requirements regarding the taking of medicine and pre-natal and other vitamins prescribed by the 
IVF Physician, the Obstetrician, and/or High-Risk Obstetrician, and to attend on time all 
scheduled doctors’ appointments.

Partner’s Initials:________                                                                              Intended Parent’s Initials: _______      
                                               
The Surrogate further agrees to submit to any medical test or procedure deemed 
necessary or advisable by the Obstetrician, High-Risk Obstetrician, and/or the IVF Physician 
including, but not limited to, amniocentesis, cerclage placement, chorionic villus sampling, high 
resolution ultrasound, and other tests after pregnancy is confirmed to detect any potential genetic 
or congenital defects in the fetus(es) and to undergo one or more amniocentesis, chorionic villus 
sampling, high resolution ultrasound or other genetic testing procedures upon the request of the 
Intended Parents.   
Surrogate further agrees that Intended Parents may select the physician to perform said 
procedure(s), even if the physician is other than the IVF Physician, Obstetrician, and/or High-
Risk Obstetrician.  The Physician’s instructions may also include, but are not limited to, frequent 
vaginal ultrasound procedures, two to three days of bed rest following the IVF-embryo transfer, 
other more extensive bed rest and/or restricted activity, abstinence from sexual intercourse, and 
self administration of medication orally and/or by injection for prolonged periods.   
The Surrogate further agrees to use all best efforts to carry the pregnancy of the Child to 
full term.  Except as otherwise stated herein, failure or refusal of the Surrogate to comply with all 
or any of the provisions of this Section shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement by 
Surrogate. 
 c. Second Medical Opinion. In the event a medical opinion is the determinant of 
any action or requirement set forth in this Agreement (i.e., bed rest, complications from delivery, 
or restricted activity), the Parties agree that either party may seek a second medical opinion by a 
physician who shall be selected by the Party requesting the second opinion.  The Intended 
Parents shall be responsible for all costs incurred with any such requested second medical 
opinion with the understanding that if the Surrogate requests a second opinion, she agrees to 
select a doctor who is “in network” of her applicable health insurance rather than one who is not, 
assuming that the professional qualifications of the two physicians are of similar or equal value. 
 The Parties agree to fully cooperate with the facilitation of the second medical opinion, 
including the completion of any requested examinations or testing.  In the event the second 
opinion fails to resolve the presenting medical issue, the Parties agree that the decision shall be 
made by a third physician, mutually selected by the said first two physicians, and the Parties 
agree to abide by that third opinion (in the event a third said physician is not mutually selected, 
the Parties agree that the selection of a third physician shall be made by a mediator mutually 
selected by the Parties).  
d.         Surrogate’s Conduct During the Term of This Agreement.  Surrogate agrees 
to take diligent care of herself during the course of and in preparation for the IVF procedure and 
pregnancy so as to do everything that is medically reasonable to care for an unborn Child and not 
engage in conduct which is detrimental to the health of an unborn Child.           
i. Diet. Surrogate agrees to maintain healthy eating habits, including 
substantially reducing her intake of processed and “fast food,” sodas and foods high in fat 
and sugar and replacing those with fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, lean meats, whole grains 
and dairy products, and a healthy lifestyle during the term of this Agreement, and to 
closely follow all dietary restrictions and instructions provided to her by the IVF

iv. Rest. Surrogate agrees to get adequate sleep, and further agrees to  
exactly follow all instructions from the Attending Physician, concerning any restricted 
activity, bed rest, and to avoid contact with persons, including children who have known

Except as stated herein, Surrogate shall select the Obstetrician for the Surrogate’s 
prenatal care and delivery, and the hospital where the delivery shall take place, provided 
that the Obstetrician and the hospital are in-network of Surrogate’s applicable insurance 
and are approved by the Intended Parents.  Said selections shall be made and designated 
as soon as reasonably possible after the execution of this Agreement.   
 
It is expressly understood and agreed that Surrogate shall deliver at a hospital 
with level 2 neonatal intensive care unit if she is pregnant with multiples. Surrogate shall 
deliver at a hospital with level 3 neonatal intensive care unit if she is required by the 
Obstetrician or the IVF Physician. The delivery hospital shall be in-network of the 
Surrogate’s insurance. In the event of the Obstetrician or the IVF Physician determine 
that the pregnancy is “high risk,” and/or should the Surrogate or the Intended Parents lose 
confidence in the Obstetrician, Surrogate agrees to change to a High-Risk Obstetrician 
and hospital selected by the Intended Parents, provided that Intended Parents shall be 
responsible for the cost.  The Parties agrees to work in good faith with each other for the 
foregoing selections.

xii.  Prior Approval for Dental Visits. Due to the risks to fetal development 
and gestation posed by some dental procedures, including routine teeth cleaning, the 
Surrogate agrees that prior to any dental procedures, including routine teeth cleaning, she 
shall obtain the written approval of the Attending Physician approving any such 
treatments and provide notice of any such treatment prior to the scheduled date to the 
Intended Parents. 
 
e.         Doctor Visits and Duty to Inform Intended Parent.   Surrogate further 
agrees that the Intended Parents, the Agreement Facilitator (if hired) and/or the Alternative 
Intended Parents defined and referenced in Section 18, shall have the right to attend all doctor 
visits including ultrasound examinations of any kind, with due respect for the Surrogate’s 
privacy and with the approval of the Obstetrician, High-Risk Obstetrician or the IVF Physician.   
Surrogate agrees to inform Intended Parents by telephone, Skype or e-mail, at least once 
per week of the progress of the pregnancy, agrees to promptly (within 24 hours) inform Intended 
Parents of any issues and/or problems which arise with respect to the pregnancy, agrees to 
inform Intended Parents of all medical appointments as soon as they are scheduled, and agrees to 
be truthful in all respects.  The Surrogate further agrees to promptly (within 24 hours with due 
consideration of the Parties differing time zones) respond to all contact initiated by the Intended 
Parents unless the Surrogate is medically unable to do so.   
The Surrogate hereby waives her doctor-patient privilege, as required to perform on 
this Agreement, and agrees to sign the release contained in Exhibit B, attached hereto and any 
other release form required to allow the Intended Parents, the Agreement Facilitator(if hired) 
and the Alternative Intended Parents to communicate with all treating or attending medical 
personnel, and to review relevant medical records pertaining to Surrogate’s pregnancy or 
health.  Surrogate shall provide a copy of any additional such signed medical release forms to 
the Intended Parents within five (5) days of Surrogate’s first appointment with her 
Obstetrician or High-Risk Obstetrician, once pregnancy is confirmed.  
 f.         Onset of Labor. Surrogate agrees that she will notify Intended Parents upon 
the onset of labor and that Intended Parents shall be allowed by her to be present in the delivery 
room during delivery of the Child, with due respect for the Surrogate’s privacy and with the 
approval of the Attending Physician and so long as medical conditions allow.  Surrogate shall 
sign any consent forms necessary to facilitate this result.  However, if the hospital restricts the 
number of people who may be present during the delivery of the Child, Surrogate understands 
that the Intended Parents shall be included, and understands others may be excluded. 
 
Surrogate agrees to use all and best efforts to deliver the Child in the selected and 
required hospital, as set forth herein, under medical supervision.  Surrogate agrees to deliver the 
Child by caesarean section and/or induce labor, if the Obstetrician, High-Risk Obstetrician, 
and/or Attending Physician so advises.  The Surrogate agrees not to do anything to induce her 
own labor and/or deliver prior to full term, unless so advised by the IVF Physician, High-Risk 
Obstetrician or Obstetrician.

 g. The Parties further agree that all pregnancy lifestyle restrictions of the Surrogate 
as set forth in this Agreement shall continue during the period of time in which the Surrogate is 
providing breast milk as mutually determined by the Parties, if at all.  
9.        ABORTION, MISCARRIAGE, AND SELECTIVE TERMINATION  
a. Subject to the terms of this Section and applicable laws, Intended Parents will 
make all abortion and fetal reduction decisions.  If requested by Intended Parents, Surrogate shall 
consent to an abortion during the time period allowed by law for any medical reason or if there is 
any indication of any physical or neurological defect or abnormality.  
b. Further, Surrogate agrees that she will not terminate the pregnancy without the 
written consent of Intended Parents; however, in the event Surrogate’s health or life is 
substantially and imminently threatened and Surrogate’s Attending Physician recommends 
terminating the pregnancy, such decisions may be made by Surrogate in consultation with the 
Attending Physician. Surrogate agrees BEFORE taking any action or making any decision 
regarding termination wherein the Surrogate’s health or life is substantially and imminently 
threated, she or the Surrogate’s Partner will use all reasonable and best efforts (taking into 
consideration her medical condition and capacity to do so at the time), to contact the Intended 
Parents BEFORE making any decisions or taking any action under this Section. 
 c.   Surrogate agrees to carry up to two (2) fetuses at one time. 
d. Notwithstanding, Surrogate and Intended Parents agrees that if three (3) or more 
fetuses are created as a result of any  individual embryo transfer procedure, at the request of the 
Intended Parents, Surrogate will undergo a fetal reduction procedure to reduce the number of 
fetuses to two (2) or one (1), at the sole discretion of the Intended Parents.  
e.  In the event the Surrogate chooses to exercise her right to abort, or not abort, or 
selectively reduce or not reduce, in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 9, it 
is understood that such action shall be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement, 
resulting in serious legal repercussions including but not limited to all remedies available to the 
Intended Parents in law and in equity, such as the Surrogate’s and Surrogate’s Partner liability 
for any added cost associated with the care of the Child and/or the cost of medical and other care 
of a Child with special needs.  In addition, in said event the Surrogate Couple shall be 
responsible for all medical expenses with respect to Surrogate’s pre-natal care and delivery, 
which are not covered and/or paid by insurance. 
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING OR ANYTHING TO THE 
CONTRARY, ALL PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT A PREGNANT WOMAN MAY 
HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO ABORT OR NOT ABORT ANY FETUS SHE IS 
CARRYING.  ANY PROMISE TO THE CONTRARY MAY BE UNENFORCEABLE.   
 f.        In the event of a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion, or abortion at the request of 
the Intended Parents, as described herein (or by the attending physician as described herein),the  
Intended Parents shall still remain liable for any reimbursements, compensation and medical 
costs incurred to date by the Surrogate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement arising from or 
reasonably relating to any such miscarriage or abortion as described in this Section and pursuant

to this Agreement which are not covered by the medical insurance discussed in Section 11 
herein, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any other provision 
contained herein, should the Parties desire another transfer procedure after any abortion or 
miscarriage provided that such transfer procedure is within the time frame specified in Section 6, 
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect between the Intended Parents and the 
Surrogate Couple and shall begin anew pursuant to Exhibit A hereto. 
 10.       CONSIDERATION 
 a.         In recognition of obligations of the Intended Parents, as set forth under California 
law, to support the Child from the time pregnancy is confirmed and as compensation, 
consideration and intended as payment to the Surrogate for her time, pain, suffering and 
inconvenience, Surrogate’s assumption of risks, waiver and release, the Intended Parents agree to 
pay the Surrogate the amount indicated in Exhibit A, attached hereto and incorporated by this 
reference. 
 b.          The Surrogate agrees to present to Intended Parents proper evidence, 
documentation, or verifiable information that the Surrogate has incurred or will incur the 
following kinds of expenses directly relating to the pregnancy and the birth of the Child, as 
described herein, which the Intended Parents shall pay forthwith: obstetrical, nursing, hospital 
and maternity care, pharmaceuticals, and pediatric care, or other medical costs payable under this 
Agreement by the Intended Parents, which are not covered by the medical insurance as set forth 
in Section 11 herein.  The Intended Parents shall be responsible for all non-covered medical 
payments not paid by Surrogate’s medical insurance related to the pregnancy, as more fully set 
forth in Section 11, below.  Payments for medical expenses not yet incurred by the Surrogate 
shall only be made when advance payment is necessary or appropriate.  The Surrogate agrees 
that, once released from the IVF Physician to the Obstetrician and/or the High Risk Obstetrician, 
to submit all bills as above described to applicable insurance carriers prior to submission for 
payment by the Intended Parents.   
 c. The Parties agree the consideration (payments) made by the Intended Parents to 
Surrogate pursuant to this Agreement constitute reasonable monetary reimbursement and 
compensation for all inconveniences, discomfort, pain and suffering, for pre-birth support, and 
for all foreseen and unforeseen losses, costs, and expenses which may be experienced by the 
Surrogate in carrying out and performing her obligations and is not payment for the Child or 
genetic material, for relinquishment or surrender of a Child, or for consent to an adoption.  
 
11.       MEDICAL INSURANCE 
a.  The Surrogate’s PRIMARY INSURANCE POLICY shall be deemed the policy 
agreed upon between the Parties and purchased and paid for by the Intended Parents. The 
Intended Parents shall be responsible for the payment of all premiums, co-pays, applicable liens 
and uncovered medical expenses. If a new policy or plan needs to be purchased for the 
Surrogate, the Intended Parents, together with the Surrogate and a qualified health insurance 
broker/agent, will evaluate the health insurance policies and plans that are then available to the 
Surrogate and select a policy or plan that will cover the maternity care of the Surrogate as a 
gestational carrier for the Intended Parents and has features (e.g., the amount of the premiums,

v1 
Surrogate’s Initials:  ______                                                                            Intended Parent’s Initials: _______  
Partner’s Initials:________                                                                              Intended Parent’s Initials: _______      
                                               
deductibles, co-payments,  co-insurance, and annual out-of-pocket maximum; and the 
obstetrician, Perinatologist, and birthing hospitals that are "covered providers" under the policy 
or plan) that are deemed satisfactory to the Intended Parents and Surrogate.  
If the Surrogate does get pregnant prior to her Primary Insurance Policy becoming 
effective, to the extent that the Surrogate's maternity care during the Pregnancy is not provided 
by the IVF Physician (the IVF Physician typically provides the gestational carrier’s primary 
routine maternity care through the tenth (10th) to twelfth (12th) gestational week of pregnancy 
and such care is included in the total fee paid directly to the IVF Physician by the Intended 
Parents), the Surrogate's maternity care and treatment will not be paid for by health insurance. 
Therefore, for this "gap" period (i.e., the period between the Surrogate becoming Pregnant and 
the effective date of the Surrogate's Primary Insurance) the Intended Parents shall either pay cash 
for the maternity medical fees, costs and expenses of the Surrogate through the date of the 
inception of the Surrogate's Primary Insurance Policy or the Intended Parents shall purchase 
coverage under a "gap" insurance policy underwritten by Lloyd's of London and obtained 
through a qualified insurance broker (hereinafter referred to as the "Gap Insurance Policy"). In 
this regard, if the Intended Parents elect to purchase the “gap” insurance, then the Intended 
Parents shall pay the premium and make deposits as required by the insurance carrier.  
Thereafter, until the Surrogate’s Primary Insurance Policy goes into effect, the Intended Parents 
shall pay for the Surrogate’s maternity care and treatment with the use of the Gap Insurance 
Policy and, to the extent not paid for by the Gap Insurance Policy, cash payment.  
b. The Surrogate understands and agrees to notify the Intended Parents immediately 
regarding any change(s) in effective insurance dates and/or coverage.  The Surrogate further 
agrees to immediately inform the Intended Parents and the Agreement Facilitator (if any) of any 
and all notices received by or that come to the attention of the Surrogate regarding medical 
insurance.  These notices include but are not limited to cancellation notices, past payment due 
notices, and changes in coverage or amendments.  In the event the Intended Parents disputes the 
insurance billing, they hereby agree that they will take reasonable action to indemnify Surrogate 
from liability, including providing to the medical providers the Intended Parents’ own 
information for contact purposes.  In the event the Surrogate’s said insurance is canceled and/or 
fails to cover the Surrogate through any fault of her own, including but not limited to any non-
payment of insurance premiums (if the premiums are to be paid directly by Surrogate), failure to 
provide Intended Parents with any notices and/or changes on the insurance, and/or any non-
disclosure or false statement on said insurance application, such conduct shall be considered a 
material breach of this Agreement affording the Intended Parents with all rights and remedies 
available to them including but not limited to the Surrogate being responsible for the payment of 
all non-covered medical expenses. 
c. In the event new or additional medical insurance needs to be purchased pursuant 
to this Agreement through no fault of Surrogate, the Intended Parents shall be responsible for the 
cost of such new or additional medical coverage.  The Surrogate shall further cooperate with the 
application and related procedures in the event the Intended Parents purchases any new or 
supplemental insurance and/or coverage with respect to the Surrogate’s medical care relating to 
the conduct contemplated in this Agreement.   In the event the Parties choose to resume a 
transfer procedure after an abortion or miscarriage, the Surrogate agrees that her medical

insurance policy shall continue to remain in effect for such period as set forth in Section 11 
herein. 
d. In the event Surrogate’s existing medical insurance is terminated not due to 
Surrogate’s fault, the Intended Parents shall be responsible for continued medical care on behalf 
of Surrogate under COBRA (if applicable) or to secure alternate, private insurance coverage for 
Surrogate as required under this Agreement.  COBRA payments shall only be that portion of 
payments attributable to Surrogate's coverage and not for any other member of her family. 
The Attorneys and any agent or employee of any said entity, are not responsible for 
evaluating any health insurance policy or benefits thereof.   Advice and/or information regarding 
the potential financial risks of the Surrogate’s existing health insurance policy are the individual 
responsibility of the Intended Parents and the Surrogate.  
e.    The Intended Parents are jointly and severally responsible for all medical 
expenses of the Child and are responsible for obtaining adequate medical insurance covering the 
Child.  The Intended Parents acknowledge that they have been advised to obtain said adequate 
insurance prior to any pregnancy.  
f.   The Intended Parents shall jointly and severally be responsible for all “Uncovered 
Medical Payments” not paid by Surrogate’s medical insurance related to the pregnancy, which 
shall be defined as those medical care expenses that are medically necessary pregnancy-related 
medical care, including annual deductibles, medical care relating to the embryo transfer 
procedure, prenatal and postpartum care and complications and which the Insurer has denied 
payment, or expressly excludes, through no fault of the Surrogate. 
g.        The Surrogate agrees to timely submit all bills for all medical treatment and care 
relating to the Surrogate’s prenatal care, delivery and recovery to the applicable insurance 
carrier(s), prior to submission due to non-payment by the Insurer to the Intended Parents.  
Provided that said bills relating to the surrogacy arrangement are timely submitted by the 
Surrogate, and except as otherwise provided herein, the Intended Parents shall be responsible to 
pay for all Uncovered Medical Payments for the Surrogate’s maternity care and treatment, which 
directly relate to the conduct contemplated by this Agreement (except for those medical expenses 
which are incurred for matters which are not reasonably necessary to perform on this Agreement, 
unless approved in writing by the Intended Parents).   
h. The Intended Parents shall be jointly and severally responsible for payment of 
Surrogate’s portion of her monthly health insurance premium, with payment continuing for three 
(3) months post birth.  If the Surrogate is specifically diagnosed with complications directly 
resulting from any of the following actions: (a.) pregnancy, (b.) the birth of the Child, (c.) 
miscarriage, abortion or other termination of pregnancy, or (d.) the IVF procedure and 
preparation for pregnancy, and such complications are diagnosed within one (1) month of any of 
the aforementioned, the Intended Parents shall agree to pay the insurance premiums to continue 
Surrogate’s health insurance policy for six (6) months, for Surrogate’s portion of the policy only 
and no other member of her family.   
 The Intended Parents’ obligation shall commence only upon receipt of written 
notice of Surrogate’s diagnosis and shall extend for no more six (6) months from such date.  The

time line delineated in this provision does not apply to when any medical bills are actually 
received, only to when the care was obtained.  However, the Surrogate Couple, and each of 
them, and not the Intended Parents are responsible for any medical expenses incurred outside the 
State of Arizona , which are not covered by insurance because the expenses are incurred outside 
the State of Arizona due to the Surrogate’s travel outside of Arizona, which is done in violation 
of the terms of this Agreement, and for such other costs and expenses which arise because the 
expenses are incurred outside of Arizona, in violation of this Agreement.  The provisions of this 
subsection shall not apply to an abortion in violation of this Agreement.   
i. If Surrogate has a choice with respect to any medical service or health care 
provider in connection with this Agreement, she will choose such health care provider that is an 
“in-network” provider covered by the medical insurance discussed in this Section 11 of this 
Agreement.  In the event of more than one said policy, the provider shall be covered by the 
insurance policy (or more than one insurance policy) as determined by the Intended Parents.  
Surrogate further agrees to reimburse the Intended Parents for all payments made directly to her 
by the insurance company for services that were paid in advance by the Intended Parents.   
j.         It is expressly understood and agreed that no attorney representing any Party 
herein shall be responsible for evaluating or investigating the existence or extent of any 
insurance coverage with respect to the conduct contemplated by the surrogacy and this 
Agreement. 
k.          It is recognized that the Intended Parents are not insurers and as such should not 
be considered third party payors.  However, nothing in this Paragraph is meant to lessen the 
Intended Parents' obligations outlined in this Section.  
l. The Surrogate agrees to reimburse the Intended Parents for any and all payments 
made directly to the Surrogate, by her medical insurance company (as opposed to payments by 
the medical insurance company made directly to the medical provider), which are for  medical 
expenses relating to the conduct contemplated in this Agreement.  
m. To the extent that any applicable insurance carrier denies, in whole, or in part, any 
medical fee, cost, or expense of Surrogate for medical care and treatment as contemplated in this 
Agreement, Intended Parents reserve the right to formally challenge such determination by said 
insurance carrier. In order to enable Intended Parents to formally dispute such a denial by the 
insurance carrier, Surrogate shall fully cooperate with Intended Parents in said dispute. Said 
cooperation may include, but is not limited to, initiating, processing, and advancing such 
challenges in Surrogate’s name as the insured Party under the Surrogate’s insurance policy, 
and/or such other cooperation as reasonably requested by the Intended Parents. 
n. Any act by any Party that interferes with the insurance coverage contemplated by 
this Agreement shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement by that Party, and that Party shall be 
responsible for all uncovered expenses resulting from that act.  In addition, to the extent that 
Surrogate’s insurance is only effective within certain geographical areas, Surrogate agrees not to 
leave the geographical area of coverage at any time during a pregnancy or possible pregnancy, 
until delivery of Child or termination of the Agreement, whichever comes first.

 o. The Parties understand that the policies of Surrogate’s future insurance carrier 
could change at any time during the term of this Agreement based either upon a change in the 
policy itself or in their interpretation of the policy.  The Parties are cautioned to fully evaluate 
the coverage provided under the policy so as to fully assess the financial risks to them for 
uncovered medical costs and expenses. The Attorneys and any agent or employee of any said 
entity, are not responsible for evaluating any health insurance policy or benefits thereof.   
Advice and/or information regarding the potential financial risks of the Surrogate’s existing 
health insurance policy are the individual responsibility of the Intended Parents and the 
Surrogate. 
 p. The fact that the Surrogate’s or the Surrogate’s Partner’s name may appear on any 
insurance forms, hospital documents, the birth certificate application or the birth certificate shall 
not be used by any party to support a claim by the Surrogate or the Surrogate’s Partner regarding 
any legal rights concerning the Child. 
             q. Surrogate shall use all best efforts to remain insured with and under the medical 
insurance policy insurer referenced herein until Intended Parents have completed their 
obligations under this Agreement to pay for health insurance premiums, deductibles, co-
payments and uncovered medical expenses.  Failure to do so shall be considered a material 
breach of this Agreement. 
r.  If the Surrogate’s medical insurance policy is terminated, or a health insurance 
claim is denied due to the Surrogate’s negligent or intentional conduct, (including but not limited 
to failure to provide copies to the Intended Parents regarding any notifications/correspondence 
received from said insurance company within 24 hours of receipt, Surrogate’s discussion to any 
medical provider, including but not limited to any medical or hospital staff regarding her 
personal opinion or belief regarding any lack of validity or applicability of said insurance) 
Surrogate shall be responsible for any unpaid medical bill(s) caused by such negligence or 
intentional conduct. 
s. Further, the Parties have been advised that California Family Code §7962 (a) has 
been amended effective January 1, 2015 to read in pertinent part,  
“(a) An assisted reproduction agreement for Gestational Carriers shall contain, but 
shall not be limited to, all of the following information: ... (4) Disclosure of how 
the Intended Parents will cover the medical expenses of the Gestational Carrier and 
of the newborn or newborns. If health care coverage is used to cover those medical 
expenses, the disclosure shall include a review of the health care policy provisions 
related  to  coverage  for  Gestational  Carrier  pregnancy,  including  any  possible 
liability  of  the  Gestational  Carrier,  third-party  liability  liens  or  other insurance 
coverage, and any notice requirements that could affect coverage or liability of the 
Gestational  Carrier.  The  review  and  disclosure  do  not  constitute  legal  advice.  If 
coverage of liability is uncertain, a statement of that fact shall be sufficient to meet 
the requirements of this section.” 
 
  In   compliance   with   California   Family   Code   Section   7962(a),   once 
purchased, the health insurance policy of the Surrogate shall be reviewed by either a health

insurance  broker  or  agent, or  attorney,  knowledgeable  and  experienced  in  surrogacy 
matters, the fees and costs for such review shall be paid by the Intended Parents.  
t. The Intended Parents are informed herein the insurance industry is always 
changing.  There is no guarantee of coverage for any plan available except for those policies 
written specifically for surrogacy (ART Risk or New Life Agency- Lloyds of London plans). 
Costs for the surrogate plans may range from $27,000-$42,000.00. If the Intended Parents 
would prefer one of these plans, they understand that this estimated amount of insurance 
premium is not specifically listed in Exhibit A. 
u. The Intended Parents understand the Surrogate’s personal health insurance 
plan shall not cover the Child’s medical expenses related to the birth or hospitalization or 
subsequent care following discharge from the hospital.  This means the Intended Parents 
are responsible for all medical expenses of the Child, and that under no circumstances, 
shall the Child be placed under the Surrogate’s medical insurance. The Intended Parents 
shall have up to the 20th week of pregnancy to make arrangements to establish a medical 
plan for the newborn Child or if requested by the Trust Administrator, they shall make the 
deposit to provide for such insurance to the trust account. 
v.  The Parties declare that they fully understand and accept Intended Parents’ 
obligation to select and pay for medical and maternity care for the Surrogate, as well as newborn 
care for the baby. This requirement is embodied in new Family Code provision, Section 
7962(a)(4). Intended Parents understand that the only practical way to provide this care is to 
purchase insurance policies for the Surrogate and newborn, and this process is now standard in 
the ART industry. This statute also requires full disclosure of the policies selected, and an 
analysis of the provisions and obligates the Parties to make sure the policies are in place and 
available when needed. 
12.       SURROGATE LIFE INSURANCE 
           a.        The Intended Parents shall pay the costs of a term life insurance policy on the 
Surrogate's life with a minimum payable death benefit of the amount in coverage as provided in 
Exhibit A hereto and naming the Surrogate’s children and/or any other family member(s) 
designated by Surrogate as the beneficiaries during the term of this agreement.   
b.            The Surrogate is solely responsible to apply for and obtain said life insurance 
which shall be facilitated by the Surrogacy Agency (if any).  Surrogate understands that it is her 
responsibility to apply for said insurance at execution of this Agreement and shall remain in 
effect for (3) three months subsequent to the birth of the Child or longer as is reasonable if 
medical complications develop, as a result of the Gestational Surrogate procedure.  The 
Surrogate agrees to provide the Intended Parents (or their agents or attorney) with a copy of the 
policy declarations page within 72 hours of receipt.  In the event the Surrogate fails to have the 
insurance required herein, or keep the same in full force and effect, the Intended Parents may, 
but shall not be obligated to purchase the necessary insurance, pay the premium and deduct said 
premium payment from Surrogate’s base fee compensation listed in Exhibit A.

            c.      The annual premiums of said policy shall not exceed the amount as provided in 
Exhibit A hereto.  The premiums on said policy shall be paid promptly upon request by the 
Surrogate and Intended Parents shall be responsible for reimbursement of said policy premiums 
if paid directly by the Surrogate.   
            d.            In the event the Parties choose to resume a transfer procedure after an abortion 
or miscarriage (in which case this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the 
termination is deemed waived, as stated herein above), the life insurance policy shall again 
remain in effect until three (3) months subsequent to the birth of the Child or termination of the 
pregnancy or until termination of this Agreement. 
             e.         The Surrogate shall fully comply and cooperate with any and all requests of any 
prospective life insurance policy carrier in obtaining a life insurance policy.  The Surrogate’s 
failure to so cooperate and comply, and/or failure to qualify, shall constitute a legal excuse for 
the Intended Parents’ failure to obtain a life insurance policy, as stated above.  
f.             The Surrogate, the Surrogate’s Partner, her heirs and assigns, agree that 
Intended Parents’ payments of medical expenses as provided in this Agreement and the 
Surrogate’s life insurance premium are adequate and the complete consideration to the Surrogate 
for assuming the risks inherent to the performance of the Surrogate’s obligations under this 
Agreement.  However, nothing in this provision shall be construed to limit the liability of any 
medical provider for medical malpractice or negligence. 
13.        FACILITATION OF LEGAL PROCESSES 
 a.        It is the express intent of the Parties, and a material term of this Agreement, that 
this Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the 
State of California.  The Parties acknowledge and agree that pursuant to Section 7960, et. seq. of 
the California Family Code, the Intended Parents may file a parentage action in the county where 
the Child is anticipated to be born, the county where the Surrogate resides, the county where the 
Intended Parents reside, the county where the assisted reproduction Agreement is executed, or 
the county where the medical procedures to the Agreement are to be performed.   
b. The Parties stipulate and agree to submit to any venue and jurisdiction within the 
State of California that conforms to the requirements of Family Law Code Section 7962 (e).  If 
necessary, all Parties hereby further stipulate and agree to execute any additional court 
documents, including but not limited to a Stipulation and Order, that outlines the legal 
justifications for the selected venue, whether based on the anticipated location for the birth of the 
child, the county where the Surrogate resides, the county where the Intended Parents reside, the 
county where the embryo transfer occurred, or the county where the agreement is executed. 
 c.         Each Party to this Agreement agrees to facilitate and cooperate in a timely manner 
with the legal proceedings (pre-birth or, only if necessary, post-birth) to establish the parental 
rights of the Intended Parents and to terminate any parental rights, if any exist, of the Surrogate 
and/or the Surrogate’s Partner to the Child.  For instance, and by way of examples only, the 
Parties agree to sign any court pleadings or documents required for the hospital’s discharge of 
the Child to Intended Parents and/or as may be necessary in connection with any legal 
proceeding necessary to effectuate the status of the Intended Parents as the sole legal parents of

the Child, including adoption if necessary or requested, and further agree to attend any court 
hearings as necessary to effectuate said status.   
 d.         The Intended Parents agree in a timely manner to confirm in writing their 
parentage after the pregnancy has been verified by, without limitation, signing a verified 
complaint and/or petition for judgment to establish Intended Parents’ sole parentage, signing 
declarations in support of said complaint and/or petition for judgment to establish their 
parentage, signing a stipulation to establish Intended Parents as the sole legal parents of the 
Child, and/or by signing any and all other pleadings or documents reasonably necessary or 
convenient to establish Intended Parents’ rights as the sole and exclusive legal parents to the 
Child.    
 e.         The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, agree, in a timely manner, to confirm in 
writing the Intended Parents’ sole parentage, and the lack of maternity, paternity and parentage 
of anyone other than the Intended Parents, after the pregnancy has been verified by, without 
limitation, signing a verified answer to Intended Parents’ complaint and/or petition for judgment 
to establish parentage, signing declarations in support of Intended Parents’ complaint and/or 
petition for judgment to establish their sole parentage, signing a stipulation to establish Intended 
Parents as the sole legal parents of the Child, and/or by signing any and all other pleadings or 
documents reasonably necessary or convenient to establish Intended Parents’ rights as the sole 
and exclusive legal parent to the Child.   
 f.         It is the responsibility of each Party to this Agreement to timely further facilitate 
the procedural aspects of establishing the parental rights of Intended Parents and terminating any 
parental rights of the Surrogate and/or the Surrogate’s Partner, among other things, obtaining 
birth certificates, citizenship documents, marriage and divorce certificates, and/or any other 
documentation which may be requested by any medical provider, governmental agency, and/or 
any of the Parties’ attorneys.  Intended Parents shall pay the cost of obtaining any of said 
documentation. 
14.      BIRTH CERTIFICATE 
 The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, agree that it is the exclusive right of the 
Intended Parents to name the Child and (to the extent permissible) to insert on the Child’s birth 
certificate the Intended Parents’ names as the sole parents of the Child.  Furthermore, the 
Surrogate Couple, and each of them, agree that the name of the Child selected by the Intended 
Parents shall be placed on the birth certificate issued in this case.  
15.       CONTACT DURING HOSPITAL STAY AND FUTURE CONTACT 
 Subject to the Child’s health and any hospital or doctor restrictions, Surrogate, (and her 
partner and/or children when applicable and requested), shall be allowed to spend approximately 
one (1) hour with the Child while the Surrogate is in the hospital until her discharge, in order to 
say “goodbye” to the Child.  If possible and permitted by the delivery hospital, the Intended 
Parents shall stay overnight in the hospital with the Child in the same room if allowed under the 
hospital’s policy and procedures.   If such accommodations are not permitted or available, the 
Parties understand that the Child shall stay in the nursery of the delivery hospital and not the 
Surrogate’s hospital room.

It is understood and agreed that the Intended Parents are requesting postpartum contact 
with the Surrogate.  Any such future contact shall cease upon the written request of either Party.  
Surrogate and the Intended Parents understand that neither is under an obligation to maintain 
and/or continue any post birth contact or communications of a personal nature. Further, in the 
event there is postpartum contact between the Parties, it shall be social in nature only and shall 
not be deemed or construed to establish, or as an attempt to establish a parent-child relationship.  
 16.       PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
 a.         The Parties acknowledge that it is in the best interest of the Child that the details 
surrounding the Child’s conception and birth shall remain private, and that any disclosure of the 
surrogate parenting arrangement to the Child, including the Surrogate’s identity, shall be left to 
the sole discretion of the Intended Parents.    
 b.        The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, agree that they will not provide, nor 
allow to be provided, any information regarding the identity of the Intended Parents and the 
Child nor any information that may reasonably lead to the disclosure of the identity of the 
Intended Parents and/or Child, to the public, news media, any form of social media (i.e., 
“Facebook”, blog or other internet venue) or to any other individual (except the professionals 
directly involved with the contemplated surrogacy arrangement) without the express written 
consent of the Intended Parents.   The Intended Parents agree they will not provide, nor allow to 
be provided, any information to the public, news media, any form of social media or to any other 
individual (except the professionals directly involved with the contemplated surrogacy 
arrangement) regarding the identity of the Surrogate as a participant in this surrogacy 
arrangement, without the express written consent of the Surrogate.   
The Parties understand that the confidentiality as described herein does not contemplate 
speaking with their own close friends, relatives or others about their own involvement in the 
surrogacy process, which conversations are permitted.  It shall not be a breach of this Agreement 
if the Surrogate’s Partner or the Surrogate posts pictures of herself pregnant or if others post 
pictures of Surrogate pregnant on Facebook or other social networking sites.  In this regard, the 
Surrogate’s Partner and Surrogate agree not to provide any identifying information regarding 
Intended Parents in relation to these posts.     
 c.         In order to maintain the confidentiality contemplated herein, in the event litigation 
arises out of this Agreement, the Parties and their legal counsel, heirs, representatives and 
assigns agree to make all reasonable efforts to maintain such confidentiality as to the general 
public.  Said reasonable efforts shall include, but shall not be limited to, requesting that records 
be sealed, requesting that gag orders be invoked, and requesting that the court and/or other entity 
maintain said confidentiality in its procedures and in the conducting of hearings and refrain from 
releasing the identity of the Parties to the public or to the news media.  
17.      CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCE 
 Prior to and during the time this Agreement is in effect, the Parties agree to immediately 
notify their attorneys or the Surrogacy Agency （if hired） of any material change in their 
circumstance, which may directly or indirectly affect this Agreement.  Such material changes

include, but are not limited to, exposure to communicable illness or toxic chemicals, change in 
insurance coverage, loss of employment, change of employment, change in marital status, 
illness, use, or ingestion of drugs or alcohol, change of address or phone or other contact 
information, or ability to perform under this Agreement.   
 If Intended Parents divorce prior to the birth of the Child or after the birth of the Child 
but prior to establishing legal parentage, Intended Parents represent and agree that their 
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, and agree to equally assume all 
parental rights and responsibilities.  Any disputes between Intended Parents regarding custody 
shall be resolved by Intended Parents through stipulation or determined by a court of competent 
jurisdiction.  In the event of any dispute, Intended Parents agree to jointly assume custody of the 
Child from the moment of birth subject to any court order, custody proceeding or injunction. 
18.       EMERGENCY CONTACT AND DEATH OF INTENDED PARENTS  
If either of the Intended Parents is not alive at the time of birth, Surrogate shall release 
the Child into the care of the survivor.   
In the event of the death of both the Intended Parents prior to the birth of the Child, the 
Surrogate shall be entitled to the performance of all terms and conditions contained in this 
Agreement, notwithstanding such event.  Should both Intended Parents not be alive at the time of 
birth, the Surrogate shall cooperate with the birth hospital and use all best efforts to release the 
Child into the care and custody of persons who have been designated by the Intended Parents as 
the “Alternative Intended Parents” in the event of their death prior to the birth. The Intended 
Parents will provide the contact information of the Alternative Intended Parents to the Agency 
within 10 days after signing this Agreement.  
It is the intent of the Intended Parents that upon their mutual death prior to birth of the 
Child, that the Alternative Intended Parents assume all rights and responsibilities set forth in this 
Agreement, including the care and custody of any Child.  The Intended Parents understand and 
agree that they shall have arranged for the support, care and custody of the Child by said 
Alternative Intended Parents, including by the preparation of a Nomination of Guardian, or the 
legal equivalent, in the Intended Parents testamentary documents to take effect upon their death.   
19.       INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL 
 a.         The Intended Parents on the one hand, and the Surrogate Couple, on the other 
hand, shall be represented by separate counsel regarding this Agreement and any subsequent 
finalization of parental rights. The Intended Parents warrant that they have consulted 
independent legal counsel, and have been advised regarding the terms, conditions, rights, duties 
and liabilities arising under the conduct contemplated by this Agreement. The Surrogate Couple, 
and each of them, warrant that they have consulted independent legal counsel concerning this 
Agreement prior to signing, and have been advised regarding the terms, conditions, rights, duties 
and liabilities arising under the conduct contemplated by this Agreement. 
 b.         The Intended Parents shall pay the fees of independent legal counsel for the 
Surrogate Couple, as provided for in Exhibit “A” hereto.  Said representation and Intended 
Parents’ obligation for payment for said representation specifically does not include any matters

Surrogate’s Initials:  ______                                                                            Intended Parent’s Initials: _______  
Partner’s Initials:________                                                                              Intended Parent’s Initials: _______      
                                               
relating to any breach or enforcement of this Agreement, or any dispute arising under this 
Agreement.  The amount of reimbursement is not intended to indicate that adequate legal 
representation has been obtained for the sum paid.  Obtaining qualified independent legal 
counsel is the sole responsibility of the Surrogate Couple.  The Surrogate and the Surrogate’s 
Partner further acknowledge that each of them has the right to select and has selected counsel of 
their choosing.   
 c.          All Parties understand that when one Party’s attorney is paid by the other Party, 
this creates a potential conflict of interest because the payment could induce the Surrogate’s 
and/or the Surrogate’s Partner’s attorneys to favor the person paying rather than vigorously 
representing the Surrogate or the Surrogate’s Partner.   
d. The Surrogate Couple, and each of them, have been advised of this potential 
conflict of interest and informed that they have the right to consult with and pay for any attorney 
of their own choosing, without reimbursement by the Intended Parents in order to avoid the 
potential conflict.  All Parties waive the potential conflict of interest in order that the Surrogate 
Couple’s legal expenses, as set forth herein, may be paid for or reimbursed by Intended Parents, 
subject to the limitations set forth herein and in Exhibit “A.” 
20.      CONFIRMATION OF GENETIC PARENTAGE 
 Prior and/or subsequent to the birth of Child, the Surrogate and the Surrogate’s Partner 
agree that each of them shall submit, if requested by Intended Parents, to a DNA or any other 
legally recognized scientific test to confirm the genetic parentage of the Child, at the expense of 
Intended Parents, under the direction of a physician designated by Intended Parents.  The 
inclusion of the Surrogate and/or the Surrogate’s Partner as genetic Parent of the Child by the 
DNA or other legally recognized scientific test shall constitute an incurable material breach on 
the part of the Surrogate and the Surrogate’s Partner, for which all legal remedies, whether in 
contract or personal injury apply, and in which event Intended Parents shall have no 
responsibility whatsoever to the Child and shall immediately deliver physical custody of the 
Child to the Surrogate Couple whom shall be legally obligated to accept delivery and assume the 
custody and care of the Child.  However, it shall not be an incurable breach in the event said 
exclusion or inclusion was a result of improper handling of ova, sperm or embryos by a third 
party. In the event the physician implants the wrong embryo(s) into the Surrogate’s uterus, the 
Surrogate and the Surrogate’s Partner shall not be held liable and shall not be deemed the legal 
parents.  The Intended Parents assume the risks of the physician implanting the wrong embryo(s) 
and hold the Surrogate Couple free and harmless therefrom.  Nothing in this paragraph, however, 
is meant to prevent the Intended Parents from recovering their losses by pursuing a medical 
malpractice or malfeasance suit against the physician. 
21.      BREACH  
 a.        In the event that any Party materially violates any of the provisions contained 
herein without legal excuse, such violation shall constitute a material breach, and in addition to 
all other remedies available at law or equity, this Agreement may be terminated forthwith at the 
option of the aggrieved Party without further liability on the part of the aggrieved non-breaching 
Party.  However, no breach or material breach of this Agreement by the Intended Parents shall

affect the rights or obligations of the Intended Parents with respect to any Child and the 
Surrogate Couple’s waiver and relinquishment of all parental or other rights with respect to any 
Child, except as otherwise specifically provided in this agreement.   
In the event of a material breach by the Surrogate and/or the Surrogate’s Partner and/or in 
the event the Intended Parents terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section due to a 
material breach by the Surrogate and/or the Surrogate’s Partner, the Intended Parents may be 
under no obligation to the Surrogate and/or the Surrogate’s Partner to reimburse any of her/his 
expenses incurred and  Intended Parents may, at their sole and exclusive discretion, be 
unilaterally and completely relieved of any and/or all of their financial obligations to the 
Surrogate and/or the Surrogate’s Partner as identified in this Agreement.  In addition, the 
Surrogate and the Surrogate’s Partner shall jointly and severally reimburse to Intended Parents 
all expenses incurred by Intended Parents in pursuit of and in preparation for this gestational 
surrogacy process and all expenses and/or compensation paid by Intended Parents, including but 
not limited to: any surrogacy agency fees, attorneys fees, Surrogate’s compensation, Surrogate’s 
expense reimbursements, medical expenses including medical screening and any amount paid to 
any physician’s office or other medical office, travel expenses and insurance premiums paid.   
In the event of a material breach by Intended Parents, or either of them, and/or in the 
event the Surrogate terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section due to a material breach 
by Intended Parents, or either of them, then Surrogate shall be entitled to receive all 
compensation and other funds payable to Surrogate under this Agreement and the Surrogate shall 
further be entitled to all other remedies at law and in equity. 
  b.       As a precondition to any violation constituting a breach, the Party committing the 
violation shall be given written notice of such alleged violation within a reasonable time after 
discovery of the violation, and shall have forty-eight (48) hours from the time of said notice to 
cure the alleged violation, if possible, or such earlier time as is warranted by the exigency of the 
circumstances of the alleged violation.   
 c.         Any violation of an express warranty herein shall constitute a material breach.  
The continued performance of an aggrieved Party following a material breach shall not constitute 
a waiver, and all rights accruing or retained by the aggrieved Party shall remain in full force and 
effect.  In the event a material breach is subject to cure, and said cure is effectuated, the 
continued performance of an aggrieved Party shall then constitute a waiver. 
22.       ASSUMPTION OF RISKS OF ABNORMAL CHILD/GENDER OF CHILD 
 Intended Parents are aware of the risks that the Child may possess physical, mental, 
genetic, and/or congenital abnormalities or defects, and that gender selection procedures may not 
produce the results desired.  Intended Parents understand these risks and agree to accept the legal 
and parental responsibilities (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement) for any Child born 
as a result of this Agreement, regardless of whether the Child possesses any genetic or congenital 
abnormalities or any physical or mental defects or regardless of the gender of the Child. 
 NOTWITHSTANDING ANY MATERIAL INCURABLE BREACH OF THIS 
AGREEMENT ON THE PART OF SURROGATE AND/OR THE SURROGATE’S 
PARTNER, INTENDED PARENTS SHALL TAKE IMMEDIATE CUSTODY OF THE

CHILD UPON BIRTH AND SHALL ASSUME FULL AND ABSOLUTE PARENTAL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CHILD, REGARDLESS OF THE CHILD'S HEALTH, 
GENDER, OR PHYSICAL OR MENTAL CONDITION, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE 
SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT. 
23. CORD BLOOD 
 If the Intended Parents request that cord blood be preserved, at or before the time of the 
Child’s birth, Surrogate agrees to fully cooperate with all procedures necessary for preservation 
of the cord blood.  Surrogate understands that collection of cord blood must be effectuated 
immediately after the Child’s birth (generally, it should be completed within 15 minutes of the 
umbilical cord being cut).  While the collection of cord blood is painless to Surrogate and Child, 
it will require Surrogate’s cooperation.  The Parties understand that once the cord blood is 
collected, it must be screened for a number of diseases before it is pronounced fit for storage.  
The Parties agree to fully cooperate in the screening process to the extent their participation is 
required.  Intended Parents shall be responsible for making all advance arrangements for 
collection and storage of the cord blood.  Intended Parents shall further be responsible for all 
costs associated with the collection, testing, and storage and transporting of the Cord blood.   
24.      LIFE SUPPORT  
 The Surrogate agrees that in the event the Surrogate is pregnant and is seriously injured 
or suffers a life-threatening condition during the second or third trimester of the pregnancy, if 
medically necessitated and advisable, and if requested by the Intended Parents, the Surrogate will 
be sustained with life support equipment to protect the fetus’ viability and ensure a healthy birth 
on the Intended Parents’ behalf.   
The Obstetrician or High-Risk Obstetrician is to determine when the optimal time for 
birth will be.  The Intended Parents shall be responsible to pay the cost of any non-covered 
expenses for said life support, in the event the life support is provided at the Intended Parents’ 
request for the sole reason of protecting the fetus’ viability.  It is expressly understood that this 
provision is specific to this Agreement only, and only for protection of the life of the Child.  The 
Surrogate represents that she does not have any testamentary documents and/or directives that 
conflict with the foregoing.   
25.     RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE EVENT OF STILLBIRTH OR MISCARRIAGE 
 In the event the Surrogate miscarries the pregnancy or delivers a stillborn Child, the 
Intended Parents are responsible for any resulting medical and/or hospitalization expenses, for 
the period as set forth in this Agreement, if not covered by the Surrogate’s insurance, and the 
cost of any funeral or cremation requested or desired by the Intended Parents. The Intended 
Parents also agree that their name will be placed on the Child’s birth certificate under such 
circumstances, to the extent legally possible, and on any death certificate for the Child, if such 
certificate is prepared.

Partner’s Initials:________                                                                              Intended Parent’s Initials: _______      
                                               
 a. Notwithstanding and subject to the termination provision set forth herein, 
the Parties agree that it is their present intention that the Surrogate will undergo a series of 
up to three  (3) embryo transfer procedures in an effort to obtain a healthy pregnancy 
within eighteen (18) months from the date of the last signature to this Agreement.  
b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, as long as Surrogate is not carrying the 
embryo(s) or fetus(es) of Intended Parents as a result of an embryo transfer procedure pursuant 
to the terms of this Agreement or awaiting the pregnancy results of said transfer, either the 
Surrogate or the Intended Parents may terminate this Agreement by one (1) day written notice to 
the other Party. If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to this section, no Party shall 
have further obligation or liability to the other Party(ies) except that terminating party shall 
reimburse the other party for any expenses or other sums incurred in the performance of non-
terminating party’s obligations under this Agreement.    
 c. In the event a pregnancy is achieved pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, this 
Agreement shall terminate three (3) months after the birth of the Child or termination of the 
pregnancy.  However, should the Surrogate suffer medical complications directly attributable to 
the birth of the Child or termination of the pregnancy, as diagnosed and determined by the 
Attending Physician (which shall be subject to the Second Opinion provision set forth in this 
Agreement) and, which are diagnosed within one (1) month of either the birth or pregnancy 
termination, this Agreement shall terminate six (6) months from the birth of the Child or 
termination of the pregnancy, whichever occurs first.  Subject to exceptions set forth in this 
agreement, the obligation of the Intended Parents regarding the Surrogate’s unpaid medical bills 
shall survive any Agreement termination. 
27.        INTENTION OF THE PARTIES 
 In the event of any claim or dispute between the Parties concerning the performance of 
the Parties contemplated by this Agreement, it is the desire of the Parties that their mutual 
intentions, as reflected in this Agreement, control the disposition of such dispute.  The Parties' 
primary intentions, as mutually expressed in the Agreement, are:  
           a.       The Parties intend that the Intended Parents shall be the sole parents of any Child 
conceived pursuant to this Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. 
           b.         Surrogate intends to provide valuable assistance to the Intended Parents by 
carrying the Intended Parents’ Child to term and thereafter delivering to the Intended Parents a 
healthy Child to the fullest extent that she is capable.  
           c.        The Intended Parents intend to utilize Surrogate's assistance to enable them to 
have a Child since they are unable to achieve this goal without the assistance of the Surrogate. 
            d.       The Parties intend for the Intended Parents to have the authority to make all 
decisions affecting the health of the Child, both in utero and after the Child's birth, subject to and 
as described herein. 
  e.      The Parties do not intend for Surrogate to be exposed to any medical risks over 
and above those normally associated with IVF, pregnancy and childbirth.  The Parties intend

Partner’s Initials:________                                                                              Intended Parent’s Initials: _______      
                                               
that, in the event there is a substantial risk of physical harm to Surrogate, she will have the 
authority to make the decisions affecting her own health. 
  f.       The Parties expressly do not intend that any of the conduct contemplated under 
this Agreement be considered a donation by and/or to the Surrogate of eggs, embryos or other 
genetic materials. 
           g.        The Parties intend to be fully bound by the terms of this Agreement 
notwithstanding any changes that may occur in the law relating to surrogacy that may otherwise 
affect their rights under this Agreement.   
28.      DISPUTE RESOLUTION/ARBITRATION 
 a. The Parties agree to mediate any dispute or claim arising between them out of this 
Agreement or any resulting transaction before resorting to arbitration or court action.  Mediation 
is a process by which parties attempt to resolve a dispute or claim by meeting with an impartial, 
neutral mediator, who is authorized to facilitate the resolution of the dispute, but who is not 
empowered to impose a settlement on the Parties.  Any said mediation shall be of reasonable 
length and the fees shall be divided equally among the Parties involved.   
b. If any Party commences an arbitration or court action (including a small 
claims court action) which is based on a dispute or claim arising or related to this 
Agreement without first attempting to resolve the matter through mediation, then in 
addition to any other remedies and damages available at law or at equity, in the discretion 
of the arbitrators or judge, that Party shall not be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, even if 
they would otherwise be available to that Party in any such arbitration or court action.   
c. In the event mediation does not resolve the dispute between the Parties, the 
Parties agree that all claims, disputes, or controversies arising out of or in relation to the 
performance, interpretation, application or enforcement of this Agreement, EXCEPT ISSUES 
PERTAINING TO LEGAL CUSTODY OF THE CHILD, PARENTAL RIGHTS AND/OR 
PARENTAGE, shall be settled in binding arbitration in California, or as otherwise appropriate as 
determined by the attorneys for the Intended Parents, with California substantive law and the 
California Arbitration Act applied, and in accordance with the then-current rules of the American 
Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award entered by the arbitrator(s) may be 
entered in any Court having jurisdiction thereto.  Costs of arbitration, including reasonable 
attorneys’ fees incurred by the prevailing Party in Court enforcement of the arbitration award 
after it is rendered by the arbitrator(s), must be paid to the prevailing Party by the Party 
designated by the Arbitrator(s) or Court.  Said arbitration shall be conducted in the English 
language and the award rendered in United States dollars.  Service of the Petition to Confirm the 
Award of the Arbitrator shall be made in the manner provided under California Code of Civil 
Procedure for notice.  Such service shall be complete on personal delivery or the deposit of the 
Petition and notice in the United States mail.  Should one Party either dismiss or abandon the 
claim or counterclaim before hearing thereon, the other Party shall be deemed the “prevailing 
Party” pursuant to this Agreement.  Should both Parties receive judgment or award on their 
prospective claims, the Party in whose favor the larger judgment or award is rendered shall be 
deemed the “prevailing Party” pursuant to this Agreement.

b. Moreover, the Parties agree that the jurisdiction and venue for any matter under

We, the undersigned, Parties to this Gestational Surrogacy Agreement, are now, and have

our knowledge and belief, that we are in full compliance with all such provisions, and 
understand that upon proof of compliance, our Gestational Surrogacy Agreement will be 
deemed presumptively valid. 
 
We, the Intended Parents, have used the services of a reliable translator/interpreter of our 
own choosing (if applicable). We declare that we understand all terms and conditions of this 
Gestational Surrogacy Agreement and assume sole responsibility for any misunderstandings 
that may occur. 
 
We also understand that the courts may/will require us to undergo a criminal background

passports, our citizenship identification cards, our dates of birth and any other information 
that may be required for this screening. 
 
We, the Parties further understand that legal clearance will not be sent to the IVF clinic until

review during the Pre-birth order process.

 EXHIBIT A  
COMPENSATION, PAYMENT SCHEDULE AND REIMBURSEMENTS PURSUANT 
TO SECTION 10: 
            This Exhibit A shall set forth the arrangement pertaining to the financial matters between 
the Intended Parents and the Surrogate Couple.  The Intended Parents and the Surrogate Couple 
shall also collectively be referred to as “Parties” or individually as “Party.”   
 
             The Parties agree that the payments made by the Intended Parents to the Surrogate 
pursuant to this Agreement constitute reasonable compensation for all pain, suffering, 
discomfort, and inconveniences endured by the Surrogate as well as for pre-birth child support, 
for all foreseen and unforeseen losses, costs and expenses for the Surrogate, in performing their 
obligations herein. The Intended parents agree to reimburse and be responsible for the expenses 
and payments set forth herein and on Exhibit “A” hereto and incorporated herein by reference. 
Such payments and expenses shall be paid directly form the Intended Parent’s Trust Account. 
            
                1.  Trust Account.    Intended Parents acknowledge that they are responsible for 
reasonable fees, costs and expenses the Surrogate and her family will incur that are incidental to 
her performance under this Agreement. The Parities agree that Agency shall have the discretion 
to approve expenses that, in its judgment, are reasonable and appropriate, so long as not contrary 
to the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, reimbursable expenses must be 
pregnancy related or related to the performance of the Agreement. Surrogate is only to be 
reimbursed up to the amount she spent out of pocket that she will not be reimbursed by another 
source. Such reimbursements are to be paid directly from the Intended Parents’ Trust Account.  
 
         Trust Account (“Trust Account”) is maintained by Law Offices of Robert Rettenmaier, PC, 
facilitated by the Agency and disbursed by Law Offices of Robert Rettenmaier, PC, who shall 
act as the Trust Account administrator (“Trust Administrator”).  The Parties agree that the Trust 
Account shall be funded with an initial amount no less than FIFTY THOUSAND ($50,000.00) 
U.S. DOLLARS (the “Initial Balance”) and subsequently, any available balance in the Trust 
Account shall not fall below FIVE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS $5,000.00 (“Minimum 
Balance”), during any pregnancy.  The Intended Parents shall wire the Initial Balance to the 
Trust Account on or before ten (10) U.S. “Business Days” (herein after “Business Days”, which 
for purposes of this Exhibit and Agreement only shall exclude federal holidays) from the date of 
the last signature to this Agreement or prior to Surrogate starting medications, whichever occurs 
earlier, to Trust Administrator. 
a. Minimum Balance. The Intended Parents shall replenish the Trust Account 
within ten (10) Business Days after receiving notice of an estimated deficiency 
of the Minimum Balance or a larger amount, of which is in the sole discretion of 
the Trust Administrator or the Agency.  Any remaining funds subsequent the 
birth of a Child shall remain in the Trust Account until approximately twelve 
(12) months after a delivery, three (3) months after termination of this 
Agreement when no pregnancy is achieved, or six (6) months after an abortion

remaining funds shall be returned directly to the Intended Parents. 
 
b. Authorizations. All payment requests from the Trust Account shall be 
authorized by the Agency.  
 
c. Payment Dispute between Parties.  All notices, demands and  
instructions for Payment to Fund Administrator from the Trust Account must be 
in writing.  In the event conflicting demands are made or served upon the Trust 
Administrator or any controversy arises between the Parties hereto or with any 
third person arising out of or relating to this Agreement and Exhibit A, Trust 
Administrator shall have the absolute right to withhold and stop all further 
performance of this Agreement until Trust Administrator receives written

statement from the IVF/OB Physician setting forth a medical determination of 
Surrogate’s inability to work along with a clear start and end date; and, (ii) a copy of pay 
stubs or other appropriate documentary proof showing that the claimed wage loss was 
incurred by Surrogate, including proof that no worker's compensation and/or disability 
benefits were paid during the time the claimed wage loss was incurred.

 Exhibit C 
 
ZIKA VIRUS 
1. Due to an international outbreak of the Zika virus, and in light of the severity of the 
virus, the World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency on February 1, 2016. 
2. The  Zika  virus  may  cause  the  infected  person  to  suffer  serious  health  problems 
including neurological defects and damage to the infected person’s immune system. 
3. The Zika virus can be transmitted by an infected pregnant woman to the fetus she 
is  carrying  and the  infected  fetus  may  suffer  irreversible  damaging  effects  on  the  brain  and 
incurable lifelong health and cognitive problems, including but not limited to microcephaly, which 
may result in incomplete brain development or death of the fetus. 
4. The  Zika  virus  is  carried  by  mosquitoes  and  can  be  transmitted  via  a  single 
mosquito bite.  
5. The  Zika  virus  also  can  be  transmitted  through  sexual  contact  with  an  infected 
person  or  a  person  who  has  been  in  a  Zika  infected  area.    Recent  studies  have  discovered  Zika 
virus in urine and saliva, but it currently is unknown whether the virus can be transmitted through 
these fluids.  Zika virus may also be transmitted through a blood transfusion if the blood donor 
was infected with the Zika virus at the time of donation. 
6. The Zika virus may cause symptoms such as low-grade fever, sore body, joint pain, 
muscle pain, headache, red eyes and/or a body rash, and those symptoms may last from several 
days to one week. 
7. Alternatively, the Zika virus may cause no detectable symptoms whatsoever to the 
infected  person  and  in  a  majority  of  cases,  there  are  no  symptoms.    Nonetheless,  an  infected 
pregnant  woman  who  has  no  detectable  symptoms  can  transmit  the  virus  to  the  fetus  she  is 
carrying. 
8. Currently, there is no vaccine or medication available to protect against infection 
of the Zika virus.  At the time of entering this Agreement, the following medical guidelines are 
recommended for the prevention infection and transmission of the disease, which the Gestational 
Carrier agrees to follow if recommended by her Treating Physician: 
a. Avoid travel to areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. 
b. Taking steps to avoid mosquito bites during the day and night;  
c. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants;  
d. Using  medically  approved  insect  repellants  as  recommended,  on  exposed  skin.  
According  to  the  U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  (CDC),  insect  repellents  are 
considered   safe   during   pregnancy   when   used   as   recommended.      Products

Surrogate’s Initials:  ______                                                                            Intended Parent’s Initials: _______  
Partner’s Initials:________                                                                              Intended Parent’s Initials: _______      
                                               
containing  the  active  ingredients  DEET,  or  IR3535  offer  safe  and  longer-lasting 
protection  as  compared  to  other  safe  repellants  such  as  oil  of  lemon  eucalyptus 
(para-menthane-diol) and Citronella based products.  
e. Using permethrin-treated clothing and gear; staying and sleeping in screened- in or 
air-conditioned rooms; and maintaining one’s home and yard so as to not allow 
small  bodies  of  standing  water  such  as  bird  baths,  ponds,  fountains  and  puddles 
from watering systems or poor drainage to exist,  given that such small bodies of 
water are likely to attract mosquitoes. 
f. The Gestational Carrier agrees to use condoms in the event she visits an affected 
area or country (i.e., Florida, Mexico) 
9. Medical recommendations regarding the Zika virus and its effects upon pregnant 
women and fetuses may  vary over the course of the Agreement, and generally may require and 
include the following: regular fetal ultrasounds; utilizing condoms during sexual activity; waiting 
at least twenty- eight (28) days after a partner has left a country impacted by the Zika virus before 
engaging in sexual activity with that partner; blood tests of the Gestational Carrier; amniocentesis; 
and other possible screening, diagnostic, and detection measures. 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein and with 
the intention of being legally bound hereby, the Parties agree to the following additional terms:  
The  Gestational  Carrier  agrees  to  follow  all  recommendations  of  the  Treating  Physician 
regarding  prevention  of  contracting  the  Zika  virus.    The  Gestational  Carrier  understands  and 
acknowledges that such recommendations may include those listed in the Recitals set forth above 
and that the Treating Physician may make recommendations beyond those listed herein.  To the 
extent  that  there  are  costs  associated  with  following  the  Treating  Physicians  recommendations, 
which costs are not covered by insurance, Intended Parents shall be responsible for all such costs. 
The Gestational Carrier and her Partner/Husband agree  and  acknowledge  that they must 
disclose to the Treating Physician any and all travel they have undergone in the twelve (12) months 
preceding   signing   of   this   Amendment;   and,   further,   the   Gestational Carrier and   her 
Partner/Husband agree that they will check the CDC list of Zika affected regions prior to any travel 
outside their home state, and will avoid travel to any such region until after delivery of a Child or 
other termination of the Gestational Carrier Agreement. 
The Gestational Carrier agrees to notify the Treating Physician immediately upon detection 
or  suspicion  of  Zika  virus  symptoms  or  upon  noticing  or  suspecting  a  mosquito  bite.    The 
Gestational Carrier agrees to take all necessary precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes 
that  are  recommended  by  her  Treating  Physician,  including  but  not  limited  to  making  all 
reasonable efforts to avoid areas reasonably known to have mosquitoes; using screen doors and 
window screens; and using mosquito/insect repellant. 
The  Gestational  Carrier  acknowledges  and  understands  that  the  Zika  virus  can  be 
transmitted  through  sexual  contact  with  an  infected  person  or  a  person  who  has  been  in  a  Zika 
infected area.  Accordingly, the Gestational Carrier agrees that she will wait at least twenty- eight

Partner’s Initials:________                                                                              Intended Parent’s Initials: _______      
                                               
(28)  days  after  any  sexual  partner  has  left  a  state  or  country  impacted  by  the  Zika  virus  before 
engaging in sexual activity with that partner and that they shall utilize condoms during all sexual 
activity for the duration of the Gestational Carrier Agreement. 
The Gestational Carrier understands and acknowledges that new information is becoming 
available  regarding  the  Zika  virus  on  a  daily  basis,  and  agree  that  this  Amendment  shall  be 
considered to incorporate such new information – and any new precautions the Treating Physician 
may  advise  based  on  that  information – without  an  additional  amendment  or  agreement  being 
required. All Parties agree that any party can provide all other parties with any printed or electronic 
materials  made  available  by  the  CDC,  the  World  Health  Organization,  or  any  other  national  or 
international organization responsible for dissemination of public health information, with a copy 
to  the  Treating  Physician;  and  that  the  other  parties  shall  review  all  such  information  and 
incorporate it into the precautions they are taking to avoid the Zika virus if recommended by the 
Treating Physician. If there is a disagreement between the Parties about the relevance of any such 
new  information,  or  about  any requested  precautions  related  to  such  new  information,  the 
disagreement shall be resolved by an Infectious Disease Physician.
